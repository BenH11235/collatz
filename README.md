This simple program can explore the graph of odd numbers generated by the Collatz process (That is: n-> odd part of 3n+1). See for example this graph of Collatz path generated by paths that have odd numbers <20 as origin points.

![Collatz graph](images/collatz_20.png)

The "images" folder also has the graph for odd numbers <1000, but really, you probably don't want to see that.

# Installation

Take a careful minute to decide how much you trust this repository, then inject it directly into your veins:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/BenH11235/collatz.git
```

# Usage

```python
from collatz import collatz
G = collatz.generate_graph(max_initial_val=30)
assert(all([len(G[node])==1 for node in G]))
assert(17 in G[11])
```
